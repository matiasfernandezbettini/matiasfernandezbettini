# ´Sup everyone this is Mati Bettini, your favorite AUTOMATION TESTER

## About me 
### I started my programming journey a few years ago little by little, learning here and there about javascript, python, and  HTML5 AND CSS3 just to scratch that itch programming awoke in me. That's when I noticed I had a bit of a talent for it, and with my foreign language teacher background I decided to give it a go since programming is not that different from learning a new language.
